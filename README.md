File List
1-A1_RIS_bundle.zip
Appendix A1: Literature Search Records
Includes 32 clean RIS-format citations, a PRISMA 2020 flow diagram, and search strategy documentation. Supports the literature review and case selection sections.
2-A2_KPT_toolkit.zip
Appendix A2: Governance Toolkit Design Materials
Contains:
•	KPT_Toolkit_v1.xlsx: Interactive decision table that generates context-appropriate policy tool combinations within 5 minutes via dropdown selection of knowledge dimensions and power configurations;
•	KPT_UserGuide_v1.pdf: Step-by-step user guide with conflict warning examples;
•	KPT_pseudoCode.py: Reference implementation code (Python 3.9) illustrating the tool's logic.
This bundle represents the core output of the research, translating the "Knowledge-Power Topology" theoretical framework into a directly usable decision-support tool.
